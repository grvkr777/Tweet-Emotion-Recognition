# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition
In this project I created a recurrent neural network and trained it on a tweet emotion dataset to learn to recognize the emotions in tweets. The dataset has thousands of tweets each classified in one of 6 emotions. This is a multi class classification problem in the natural language processing domain. I used TensorFlow as my machine learning framework.
